### Whats is mint?
Minting is like stamping your digital art on the blockchain forever, turning it into an NFT. On ZORA, you might pay a small fee (the infamous "gas fee") to lock it in.

Once itâ€™s minted, you can sell or trade it. If someone loves it, you could make some cash. Simple as that. Now go have fun in the Web3 world! ðŸ˜Ž
